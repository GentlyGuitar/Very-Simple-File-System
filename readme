This an implementation of the very simple file system proposed in "OS three easy pieces". The original
chapter(design) can be found in the end of this doc. In addition, RPC is supported.

[usage]
VS file system assumes you have a file called "vdisk" in the same directory. The file acts as the
virtual the file system operates on. The size of "vdisk" should be 100M. The maximum file size is 4M.
The maximum file number is 24320.

File descriptor is represented by an unsigned integer, which starts from 0. The new file descritor
will simply increment. So when a file is close, its file descriptor won't be reused.

[build]
make -f Makefile.vsfs
make -f Makefile.rpc (optional)
./sh: run file system
sudo ./shell_server: run rpc server (optional)
./shell_client: run rpc client (optional)

[functionality]
supported commands:
mkfs: mkfs
  - Make a new file system, i.e., format the disk so that it is ready for other file system operations.
open: open <filename> <flag>
  - Open a file with the given <flag>, return a file descriptor <fd> associated with this file. Example:
    open foo w shell returns SUCCESS, fd=5
read: read <fd> <size>
  - Read <size> bytes from the file associated with <fd>, from current file offset. The current file offset
    will move forward <size> bytes after read. Example: read 5 10
write: write <fd> <string>
  - Write <string> into file associated with <fd>, from current file offset. The current file offset will
    move forward the size of the string after write. Here <string> can be in double quote or not. If the
    end of the file is reached, the size of the file will be increased. Example: write 5 "hello, world"
seek: seek <fd> <offset>
  - Move the current file offset associated with <fd> to a new file offset at <offset>. The <offset> means
    the number of bytes from the beginning of the file. Example: seek 5 10
close: close <fd>
  - Close the file associated with <fd>. Example: close 5
mkdir: mkdir <dirname>
  - Create a sub-directory <dirname> under the current directory. Example: mkdir foo
rmdir: rmdir <dirname>
  - Remove the sub-directory <dirname>. This directory has to be empty when it is removed. Example: rmdir foo
cd: cd <dirname>
  - Change the current directory to <dirname>. Example: cd ../../foo/bar
ls: ls
  - Show the content of the current directory. No parameters need to be supported.
cat: cat <filename>
  - Show the content of the file. Example: cat foo
tree: tree
  - List the contents of the current directory in a tree-format.
import: import <srcname> <destname>
  - Import a file from the host machine file system to the current directory. Example: import /d/foo foo
export: export <srcname> <destname>
  - Export a file from the current directory to the host machine file system. Example: export foo /d/foo

Also support running a binary executable in the shell. Example: ./hello 

[development enviroment]
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 (Maipo)

[organization]
+-------+--------------+-------------+-----------------+----------------+
| super | inode bitmap | data bitmap |      inode      |      data      |
+-------+--------------+-------------+-----------------+----------------+
0k      256k           512k          1M                5M               100M

inode size: 256k
data block size: 4k

- Max capacity calculation
max inode number: 4M/256 = 16384
max 4k block number: 95M/4k = 24320

Considering most files are less than 4k, max file number should be slightly less than 4k block number.

[bitmap]
VS file system uses bitmap to keep track free inode and 4k block.

[inode]
Following properties are currently supported:
+------------+
| type       |
+------------+
| size       |
+------------+
| capacity   |
+------------+
| date       |
+------------+
| L0 address |
+------------+
| L1 address |
+------------+

- Regular file has type 0. Directory has type 1.

- Capacity means how many 4k block has been used. When writing into file, if file offset is greater
  than capacity, a new 4k block will be allocated.

- Date is represented by a fixed length char array. The length is 25. An example of date format is
  Sun Feb 28 19:37:28 2016.

- L0 address is direct address. Considering most files are less than 4k, only one direct address is used.

- L1 address is indirect address. It points a 4k block. If an address has size of 4 bytes, a 4k block
  supports 1k addresses, which means 4M max file size.

A L2 address is under development which supports two level indirect address and a max file size of 4G.

[block assignment]
When a new file/directory is created, a new inode id and a new 4k block will be assigned to it. Inode id
starts from 0;

[address mapping]
A file should be continuous in user's level, but in disk they have to be made up of scattered 4k block.
Address mapping should be implemented to provide service for file reading and writing. In other words,
given a file offset, the offset should be mapped to a physical address on disk. This is implemented in
calcDiskAddress() and is my favorite part of the program. 

[current working dir]
The program maintain a cwd pointer, which also points to the inode if of current working directory.
When making new file in another directory, cwd points that directory first and after new file is created
cwd will be resumed to what it was.

[file descriptor]
File descriptor starts from 0. No reserved number for stdin, stdout and stderr. Everytime when a file is
opened, file descriptor increments and assign to the opened file. The program maintains a map, which maps
a file descriptor to its inode id and its file offset. When the file is closed, the entry in the map will
ne removed.

[directory entry]
Every file in a directory is a directory entry. The table below describes its representation.
+----------+----------+-----------------+
| inode id | name len | name char array |
+----------+----------+-----------------+
When an entry is deleted. Its inode id is set to -1. So when iterating entries in a directory, the deleted
entry will be skipped. When en entry is added to the directory, the file system will first find if there is
any deleted area which has enough space to contain the new entry. If not, it will appended the new entry to
the end of directory file.

[initialization]
When file system is created, all data on the disk will be removed. A new dir called root will be created
automatically, which has inode id 0.

[abstraction]
+-------------------------+
| write(), read(), seek() |  --> application layer (file reading and writing)
+-------------------------+
| writeData(), readData() |  --> mapping layer (writing continuous data chunk to incontinuous 4k block)
+-------------------------+
| dread(), dwrite()       |  --> physical layer (abstraction of disk I/O)
+-------------------------+

[rpc support]
+----------------------+         +------------+	      +------------+
| backend file system  |  ---->  | rpc server |  -->  | rpc client |
| 	       	       |  <----  |     	      |  <--  | 	   |
+----------------------+   ipc   +------------+       +------------+
rpc server forks a subprocess to run backend file system and pipe commands sent by client to file system.
When the command is executed, result is returned to rpc server and then to rpc client.

[test]
Testing a file system is also challenging. The following is how I test this very simple file system.

- address mapping test
  Open a file, seek to 10000, write foo. Cat the file and see if you can see 10000 space and a foo in the
  end.

- import/export test
  import a file and export it immediately. Diff the original file and the one exported from VS file system.
